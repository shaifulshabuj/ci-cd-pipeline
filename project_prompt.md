## Instruction for Copilot

You are helping me build a CI/CD pipeline for a Dockerized microservice project using GitHub Actions.

- Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` with steps for build, test, and deploy to AWS ECR.
- Add a sample Dockerfile and `deploy.sh`.
- All secrets will be stored in GitHub Actions Secrets (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ACCOUNT_ID, AWS_REGION).
