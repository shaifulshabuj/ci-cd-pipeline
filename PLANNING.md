# CI/CD Pipeline Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for microservice deployment. The pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions and Docker.

## Scope
The CI/CD pipeline will include:
- Source code management with GitHub
- Automated build and testing
- Containerization with Docker
- Image publishing to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Deployment automation

## Technology Stack
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD Tool**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Registry**: AWS ECR
- **Deployment Target**: To be determined (likely ECS, EKS, or EC2)

## Architecture
1. **Development**: Developers push code to GitHub repository
2. **CI Pipeline**: 
   - GitHub Actions triggered on push/pull request
   - Code linting and testing
   - Docker image building
3. **CD Pipeline**:
   - Docker image publishing to AWS ECR
   - Deployment script execution for target environment

## Security Considerations
- AWS credentials stored as GitHub Secrets
- Image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Least privilege principle for service accounts

## Monitoring and Feedback
- GitHub Actions status reporting
- Deployment success/failure notifications
- Service health checks post-deployment

## Future Enhancements
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) integration
- Automated rollbacks
- Canary deployments
- Integration with monitoring tools
